Commentary- What elections in a coronavirus outbreak could look likeGovernments, election authorities and legislators must grapple with whether to postpone polling days and how to manage campaigning and voting if elections are called, says SafeProâ€™s Ross Darrell Feingold. For this reason, the ongoing Democratic party primary voting in the United States, South Koreaâ€™s National Assembly election in April, and a possible Singapore election amid a coronavirus outbreak should concern election commissions, political leaders and voters. In many jurisdictions, national and local governments are empowered under existing constitutional or legislative provisions during national emergencies to postpone elections. LESSONS FROM PAST Similarly, the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea did not coincide with an election. More recent developments may be instructive. The Israeli health ministry encouraged voters to exercise voters democratic right to vote and re-assured the public of safety and hygiene standards at polling stations. MEET DONâ€™T GREETAs Mass events like rallies are potential super-spreader events that should be done away with. AT THE POLLING STATIONAuthorities must balance encouraging voter turnout against the need to reduce congregating and visits to polling stations by vulnerable population segments such as the elderly. Others are considering scaling up curbside voting, typically reserved for people with disabilities, so voters can vote without getting out of voters cars, or even e-voting but the US Democrat Iowa caucus has shown tech is no panacea and technical glitches can feed misinformation.
